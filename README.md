## Overview

CommuteGuardian is an innovative AI application specifically crafted to enhance traffic safety for San Jose commuters. It leverages advanced machine learning techniques to deliver precise and actionable insights, transforming complex traffic data into clear, life-saving recommendations.

### Data Sources & ML Architecture
- **Historical Data**: Real traffic incident records from San Jose Open Data Portal
- **Predictive Models**:
  - Logistic Regression for probability estimation
  - Random Forest for capturing non-linear patterns
  - Synthetic data generation using SMOTE and GANs

## Features

### üéØ Predictive Risk Modeling
- Real-time accident probability forecasting
- Multi-factor analysis including:
  - Time patterns (rush hours, night travel)
  - Weather conditions (rain, visibility)
  - Road characteristics
  - Historical incident patterns

### üìä Advanced Analytics Dashboard
- Neighborhood safety profiling
- Time-based risk pattern analysis
- Weather impact visualization
- Traffic density heat maps

### üó∫Ô∏è Dynamic Hazard Mapping
- Interactive Folium-based visualization
- Real-time risk zone highlighting
- Custom safety overlay layers
- Route-specific risk assessment

### üîî Intelligent Safety Alerts
- Context-aware recommendations
- Time-sensitive route guidance
- Weather-based precautions
- Emergency response integration

## Technical Architecture

### Core ML Stack
- **Primary Models**:
  ```python
  from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Samirrahman71/SJCAPP.git
cd SJCAPP

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
# Add your API keys to .env

# Launch application
streamlit run 1_üè†_Home.py
```

## Usage

### Risk Assessment
```python
# Example risk calculation
risk_score = model.predict_proba(features)[[0, 1]]
```

### Route Planning
```python
# Generate safe route
safe_route = route_optimizer.find_safest_path(
    origin=start_point,
    destination=end_point,
    time=current_time
)
```

## Deployment

### Cloud Deployment
