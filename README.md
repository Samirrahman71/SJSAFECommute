## üì¶ Installation

1. **Clone the repo**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Samirrahman71/SJCAPP.git
   cd SJCAPP
   ```
2. **Create & activate a virtual environment**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate         # macOS/Linux
   venv\Scripts\activate            # Windows
   ```
3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### ‚öôÔ∏è API Key Configuration

- Create a `.env` file in the project root
- Add the following keys:
   ```env
   GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_google_maps_api_key_here

## üß† AI & Machine Learning Methods

This application incorporates several advanced AI and machine learning techniques:

### Predictive Modeling
- **Ensemble Learning**: Combines multiple prediction models for more accurate safety scores
- **Gradient Boosting**: Used for feature importance in crash risk factor analysis
- **Logistic Regression**: Implements probabilistic classification of route safety levels

### Data Processing
- **Statistical Pattern Recognition**: Identifies significant patterns in crash data
- **Spatial Clustering**: Detects high-risk areas and accident hotspots
- **Time Series Analysis**: Analyzes temporal patterns in accident occurrence

### Natural Language Processing
- **Contextual Understanding**: Processes natural language queries about route safety
- **Response Generation**: Creates personalized safety recommendations
- **Intent Recognition**: Identifies user safety concerns from conversational input

### Example Code (Safety Prediction)
```python
def calculate_safety_score(route_features, time_features, weather_features):
    # Feature engineering
    combined_features = np.concatenate([route_features, time_features, weather_features])
    
    # Apply ensemble model for prediction
    base_score = ensemble_model.predict(combined_features)
    
    # Apply confidence adjustment
    confidence = ensemble_model.predict_proba(combined_features).max()
    
    # Return final score and confidence level
    return adjusted_score, confidence
```

### Example Code (Risk Hotspot Identification)
```python
def identify_risk_hotspots(latitude, longitude, radius=1.0):
    # Find incidents within radius
    nearby_incidents = spatial_index.query_radius(
        point=(latitude, longitude),
        radius=radius
    )
    
    # Calculate risk factors
    if len(nearby_incidents) > threshold:
        return cluster_incidents(nearby_incidents)
    else:
        return []
```
